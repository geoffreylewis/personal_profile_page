# Techdegree Project 1: Personal Profile Page

## Software Summary

I customized a web page template (provided by Team Treehouse) with my own images, text, and styling.  It is essentially a hybrid between a professional profile and a personal one.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Additional Notes

This was my first time uploading to GitHub (and using GitHub Desktop to do so).  I even learned how to write/format my first README file (yes, this one that you're reading right now).
