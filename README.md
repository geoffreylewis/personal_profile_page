# Personal Profile Page

## Software Summary

I customized a web page template (provided by Team Treehouse) with my own images, text, and styling.  It is essentially a hybrid between a professional profile and a personal one.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Additional Notes

* This was my first ever web creation of any kind!
* This was also my first time uploading to GitHub (and using GitHub Desktop to do so).  
* I learned how to write/format my first README file (yes, this one that you're reading right now).
* All of the code has been successfully run through the W3C HTML/CSS validators; there are no errors.
